Final - bootstrap website

## Development Process and Challenges

**Process:**
I started with Bootstrap for the content structure and added custom CSS for styling. This approach helped me deal with Bootstrap's grid system and components while designing for my specific needs.

**Challenges Faced:**
One of the main challenges was managing the schedule for deadlines for different classes. In terms of technical challenges, integrating custom styles with Bootstrap's default properties. Additionally, ensuring that my custom CSS did not conflict with Bootstrap’s styles while trying to achieve the desired design was tricky.

**Solutions:**
To overcome these challenges, I alloted specific dates for doing the projects. I also used more specific CSS selectors to override Bootstrap's default styles. Additionally, I used Chrome DevTools to inspect and adjust styles dynamically, which was essential for fine-tuning the final look.
